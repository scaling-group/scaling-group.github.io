Scientific Computing and Intelligence Group (Scaling Group) is in the Department of Mathematics at National University of Singapore, led by Dr. Liu Yang (杨柳). 

We aim to:
 - Build modern scalable AI for scientific challenges, including multi-physics prediction, control design, inverse problems, etc.
 - Address some important fundamental questions in AI, including how to enhance accuracy and efficiency, how to generalize from easy to hard tasks, how emergent capabilities arise, etc.

These application challenges are connected by the fundamental questions underlying. 

**We are  looking for passionate new students, postdocs, and visiting scholars to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/openings) **!**
