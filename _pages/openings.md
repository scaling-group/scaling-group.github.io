## Scaling Group

Scientific Computing and Intelligence Group (Scaling Group) is in the Department of Mathematics at National University of Singapore, led by Dr. Liu Yang (杨柳). 

Dr. Yang is currently an Assistant Professor, awarded the [NUS Presidential Young Professorship](https://www.nus.edu.sg/careers/nus-programmes). Before joining NUS, he was an Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA. He obtained his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Brown University in 2021, and B.E. in Engineering Mechanics from Tsinghua University in 2016.

## Join Us

It is an exciting time to be a researcher. The recent rise of large language models is just the start of a new era of artificial intelligence. We are interested in:
- Building modern scalable AI for scientific challenges, including multi-physics prediction, control design, inverse problems, etc.
- Some important fundamental questions in AI, including how to enhance accuracy and efficiency, how to generalize from easy to hard tasks, how emergent capabilities arise, etc.


We are looking for motivated students, postdoc, and visiting scholars to explore with us. **We still have openings for postdocs!**
If you are interested, please send an email to Dr. Yang (yangliu at nus dot edu dot sg) with your CV and a brief description of your research interests.


##  Mentoring Philosophy

- **Culture**: We value culture as the most important thing in the group. We aim to build a group with a culture of integrity, passion, open-mindedness, active communication and collaboration. Diverse backgrounds are embraced.
- **Research Goal**: We desire research that not only addresses issues but also pioneers a shift in the community's viewpoint on the issues.
- **Systematic**: Just like other research fields, AI research should be organized in a systematic way.
