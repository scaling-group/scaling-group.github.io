## Join Us

It is an exciting time to be a researcher. I believe the recent rise of large language models is just the start of a new era of artificial intelligence. I am interested in:
- Building modern scalable AI for scientific challenges, including multi-physics prediction, control design, inverse problems, etc.
- Some important fundamental questions in AI, including how to enhance accuracy and efficiency, how to generalize from easy to hard tasks, how emergent capabilities arise, etc.

These application challenges are connected by the fundamental questions underlying. I am looking for motivated students and postdocs to explore with me. If you are interested, please send me an email (see[here](../team)) with your CV and a brief description of your research interests.


##  Mentoring Philosophy

- **Culture**: I value culture as the most important thing in the group. I aim to build a group with a culture of integrity, passion, open-mindedness, active communication and collaboration. Diverse backgrounds are embraced.
- **Research Goal**: I desire research that not only addresses issues but also pioneers a shift in the community's viewpoint on the issues.
- **Systematic**: Just like other research fields, AI research should be organized in a systematic way.
